## **Performance Mechanics 1** Response Time

  Sites lose half their visitors while loading. Speed index determines how long it takes for the visible content of a webpage to appear. Any webpage that **fail to load within 3 seconds** are known to **lose visitors**.

  The research results are characterized as below

  | Response Time      | User Perception       | End Result |
  | ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------- |
  | 0.1 second         | Direct Control        | User feels full control as holding a tool in hand. They will be willing to let the visual manifestation happen.  |
  | 1 second           | Indirect Control      | User notices the delay but still feels in control over the site experience. |
  | 10 seconds         | Little Control        | The user loses attention and just moves on. Probably lost forever. |

### **Performance Mechanics 1** : Response Time

  Sites lose half their visitors while loading. Speed index determines how long it takes for the visible content of a webpage to appear. Any webpage that **fail to load within 3 seconds** are known to **lose visitors**.

  The research results are characterized as below

  | Response Time      | User Perception       | End Result |
  | ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------- |
  | 0.1 second         | Direct Control        | User feels full control as holding a tool in hand hence will let the visual manifestation happen.  |
  | 1 second           | Indirect Control      | User notices the delay but still feels in control over the site experience. |
  | 10 seconds         | Little Control        | The user loses attention and just moves on. Probably lost forever. |

#### **Peformance Goal 1** : Response Time

![it's doable, trust me !](img/your-goal-is-3-seconds.svg)

You need to **make your pages load in less than 3 seconds** for every user from anywhere every single time.
